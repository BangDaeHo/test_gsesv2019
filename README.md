# test_gsesv2019

GSE SV 2019

## OBJECT

Each group should write the Markdown file.

For example, Group A uses the file named `GroupA_Intro.md`, `GroupA_Jobs.md` & `GroupA_Favs.md`; Group B the file `GroupB_Intro.md`, `GroupB_Jobs.md` & `GroupB_Favs.md`; and the same hereinafter.

Then, each member of a particular group will collaborate writing up these `.md` files. Be sure to utilize pull requests when commiting, then ask one of the group colleagues to approve the request.

## PLEASE NOTE

Before you start group collaboration and actual editing, be sure to:

* **fork** from this repository (i.e. https://github.com/shaolin405mi16/test_gsesv2019), by the group leader.
* then tell the URL of your forked repository to other members.
* and you all are now ready for collaborative group editing.

## Contents to be written

* `Group?_Intro.md`: Introduction to the Department of Global Software Engineering, in your (group's) own words
* `Group?_Jobs.md`: List of what kind of job(s) in what kind of field(s) you'd like to do after the graduation
* `Group?_Favs.md`: List of the description about your best favourite things so far
