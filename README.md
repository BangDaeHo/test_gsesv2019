GSE SV 2019

## OBJECT

Each group should write the Markdown file.

For example, Group A uses the file named `GroupA/Intro.md`, `GroupA/Jobs.md` & `GroupA/Qs.md`; Group B the file `GroupB/Intro.md`, `GroupB/Jobs.md` & `GroupB/Qs.md`; and the same hereinafter.

Then, each member of a particular group will collaborate writing up these `.md` files. Be sure to utilize pull requests when commiting, then ask one of the group colleagues to approve the request.

## PLEASE NOTE

Before you start group collaboration and actual editing, be sure to:

* switch to the branch of your group (i.e. if you're in the Group A, switch the branch from `master` to `group_A`)
* and you all are now ready for collaborative group editing.
* after each edit, you should create pull requests for other group member's approval.

## Contents to be written

* `Group?/Intro.md`: Introduction to the Department of Global Software Engineering, in your (group's) own words
* `Group?/Jobs.md`: List of what kind of job(s) in what kind of field(s) you'd like to do after the graduation
* `Group?/Qs.md`: List anything you want to ask me - business, development, family, daily chores, past, etc.
